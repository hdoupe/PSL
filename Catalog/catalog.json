This dataframe is cached in a pickle file to be used in later runs, thereby reducing run time.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the reform policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the refrom policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The CSV output files can be compared to the <code>./run_examples/*_expected.csv</code> files that are checked into the repository to confirm that you are generating the expected output.  If you run into errors running the example script, please open a new issue in the B-Tax repo with a description of the issue and any relevant tracebacks you receive.</p> <p>The <strong>second way</strong> to use B-Tax is through a web application, <a href=\"http://www.ospc.org/ccc\">Cost of Capital Calculator</a>.  This way allows you to generate estimates of marginal effective tax rates and the cost of capital across production industries, type of asset, and separately for corporate and non-corporate entites and different forms of financing.  The web application is limited in that you cannot consider policy reforms to the individual income tax code.</p> <p>Of course, you can get started with B-Tax both ways.</p>"
